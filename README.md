If you are wondering why there are some missing numbers is because the lesson or the task wasn't directly related with the code and didn't require any modification of the code.

Additionally, if you want to extend your project you might want read the code in the other branches.

#### Branches

The exercise branches are called `Task-3.x`, where `x` stands for exercise number.

The extra content branches start with a number which is the order and the feature added, ex. `1-improve-the-lists-design`.

If you want to clone a particular branch to review the code in your computer, first make sure to be in a different folder of your own project. Then you can do the following (change the branch name if you want a different branch):

```
git clone https://github.com/jorgecortesdev/cf-3-myFlix-client.git
cd cf-3-myFlix-client
git checkout Task-3.2
```

Or

```
git clone https://github.com/jorgecortesdev/cf-3-myFlix-client.git --branch Task-3.2
